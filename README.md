# js-plus-canvas-project

A simple interactive vanilla js script using canvas and client-x to change shapes' colors on-click.

I have greater ambitions for this rough outline, and plan to fill it out into a more sophisticated pattern and need to eliminate some unfinished problems such as inability to change color of whitespace.

Still it proved my point, when told by an advanced student that I couldn't do it, that it's possible to use client-x to make canvas interactive.
